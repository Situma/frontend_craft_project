# Frontend Craft Project

This project was designed to test your abilities to take a typical work product from a developer 
and execute the user interface as designed by a UX/UI specialist.

Your goal is to use the existing Angular application code and modify the components HTML and Styling (LESS, SCSS, SASS, CSS)
to meet or exceed the design mockup provided.

If you are not as familiar with Angular you may choose to do the project with a different framework, however you will have to do 
all the leg work setting up that framework. Keep in mind Angular is the main framework we work with.

## Expectations

We are wanting you to spend no more than 4 hours, and do not expect 100% completion.

When submitting please include a brief overview of your approach and priorities (bullet point is great).

# Angular Application Info

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

We do not require you to write all the unit tests for this project, however we do value an understanding of how unit testing works.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

We do not require you to write E2E tests for this project, however we do value an understanding of how E2E testing works.

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
